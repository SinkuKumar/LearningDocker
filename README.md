     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
     ```
  3. Explore basic commands:
     - `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`, `docker rmi`.
  4. Inspect container logs and details:
     - `docker logs <container-id>`
     - `docker inspect <container-id>`
  5. Practice stopping, starting, and removing containers.

#### **Day 6-7: Dockerfile Basics**
- **Objective:** Build custom images using Dockerfiles.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write your first `Dockerfile`:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine
     CMD ["echo", "Hello, Docker!"]
     ```
  2. Build and run the image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t hello-docker .
     docker run hello-docker
     ```
  3. Learn Dockerfile instructions:
     - `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`, `EXPOSE`, and `ENV`.

### **Week 2: Intermediate Docker**

#### **Day 1-2: Working with Volumes**
- **Objective:** Understand how to persist data in containers.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Learn about volumes (`docker volume` commands).
  2. Run a container with a volume:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -v /mydata:/data nginx
     ```
  3. Explore anonymous and named volumes.

#### **Day 3-4: Networking**
- **Objective:** Understand Docker networking.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Learn about the default bridge network.
  2. Explore network commands:
     - `docker network ls`, `docker network inspect`.
  3. Create a custom network:
     ```bash
     docker network create my_network
     docker run --net my_network --name container1 nginx
     ```
  4. Practice container-to-container communication.

#### **Day 5-6: Docker Compose**
- **Objective:** Manage multi-container applications.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Install Docker Compose.
  2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for a simple web app:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         ports:
           - "8080:80"
     ```
  3. Use commands:
     - `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`.
  4. Add a database service (e.g., PostgreSQL).

#### **Day 7: Practice Projects**
- **Objective:** Solidify your learning with hands-on practice.
- **Projects:**
  1. Create a simple Flask app and containerize it.
  2. Use Docker Compose to link a Flask app and a PostgreSQL database.

- **Objective:** Learn to build efficient and secure images.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Optimize Dockerfile with multi-stage builds.
  2. Learn best practices for reducing image size.
  3. Scan images for vulnerabilities using:
     ```bash
     docker scan <image-name>
     ```

#### **Day 3-4: Advanced Networking and Orchestration**
- **Objective:** Understand advanced networking and orchestration basics.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Use overlay networks with Docker Swarm.
  2. Learn about service discovery and load balancing.
  3. Deploy a simple Swarm:
     ```bash
     docker swarm init
     docker service create --name my_service -p 8080:80 nginx
     ```

#### **Day 5-7: Docker in CI/CD**
